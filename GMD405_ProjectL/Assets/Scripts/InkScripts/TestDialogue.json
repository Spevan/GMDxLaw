The witness cannot be expected to comment on such a nebulous concept.","\n","^Sustained. Mr. Wright, rephrase your question.","\n","^Wright: Mr. Slugger, how many baseball bats does Slugger’s Sports produce annually?","\n","^(Nervously) Around… around a million. Give or take.","\n","^A million bats. That’s quite a few. Now, Mr. Slugger, are these bats rigorously tested for safety and durability?","\n","^(Sweating profusely) Of course! We have the highest standards. Safety is our… our top priority.","\n","^Is that so?","\n","^(Slams a photo on the desk)","\n","^Exhibit A! This is a photograph of a baseball bat, manufactured by Slugger’s Sports, that shattered upon impact during a little league game. The shards of wood caused serious injuries to a young player.","\n","^(Eyes darting around) That… that was an isolated incident! A faulty bat. It happens.","\n","^Objection!","\n","^The witness is speculating. There is no evidence to suggest the bat was faulty.","\n","^Overruled. The witness may answer.","\n","^(Muttering) Like I said, it happens. One in a million.","\n","^One in a million?","\n","^(Presents another photo) Exhibit B! Another shattered bat. Another injured child. And…","\n","^(Presents a third photo) Exhibit C! A third bat, a third injury. Mr. Slugger, are these also \"isolated incidents\"?","\n","^(Visibly shaken) We… we…","\n","^Objection! The prosecution is engaging in inflammatory tactics.","\n","^These photos are designed to elicit an emotional response from the jury, not to present factual evidence.","\n","^Sustained. Mr. Wright, please refrain from such dramatic presentations. Focus on the facts.","\n","^(Composed) Of course, Your Honor. Mr. Slugger, let’s talk about your company’s quality control procedures. Can you describe them for the court?","\n","^(Stammering) We… we have checks and balances. Inspections. Everything.","\n","^\"Everything\"?","\n","^(Pulls out a document) Exhibit D! This is an internal memo from Slugger’s Sports. It details a cost-cutting measure that significantly reduced the number of quality control checks on your baseball bats. It even mentions the potential for increased… “failure rates.”","\n","^(Pale) That… that memo…","\n","^Objection! This memo is hearsay! There is no proof of its authenticity.","\n","^I’ll provide that proof, Your Honor. (Turns to Slugger) Mr. Slugger, is this your signature at the bottom of this memo?","\n","end",["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
